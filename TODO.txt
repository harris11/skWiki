sWiki Fixes to do
[] Right now there are different line weight/ line colour settings for
    individual canvases, which is confusing. Instead, have a single
    settings dialog for both, and apply it to all canvases. 
[] Clearly identify the active canvas
[] Provision to delete/hide canvases?
[X] A preview of the sketch should show its active canvas, or all
    canvases. The study with ME 444 had it showing the preview of the
    first canvas created, which persisted even after the canvas was
    minimized.
[] Time of last save: change it to "x minutes ago" instead of absolute
    time.
[] Increase handle sizes on path viewer
[X] When the path viewer windows moves over other buttons (All Projects,
    Take Screenshot, Logout), clicking on the path viewer accidentally
    clicks these buttons.
[] Server lag: may not be a fixable issue
