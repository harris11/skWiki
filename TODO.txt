skWiki Fixes to do

[] Right now there are different line weight/ line color settings for individual canvases, which is confusing. Instead, have a single settings dialog for both, and apply it to all canvases. 
[X] Clearly identify the active canvas
[] Provision to delete/hide canvases?
[X] A preview of the sketch should show its active canvas, or all canvases. The study with ME 444 had it showing the preview of the first canvas created, which persisted even after the canvas was minimized.
[X] Time of last save: change it to "x minutes ago" instead of absolute time.
[X] Increase handle sizes on path viewer
[X] When the path viewer windows moves over other buttons (All Projects,  Take Screenshot, Logout), clicking on the path viewer accidentally clicks these buttons.
[] Slow resize and dnd operations especially once sketched 
[X] Server lag: may not be a fixable issue
[X] Fix Text upload
[X] Fix zoom 
[] Prevent default clicks 
[] Place the tool bar on top
[] Resize issue
[ ] “Erased” marks were showing up when Joran was moving the canvas around
[ ] Sketching lag increases very quickly after making a few sketches 
[X] Inadvertent zoom events (happens when accidentally touching the canvas while sketching, or when dragging the canvas handles too slowly)
[ ] Chrome crashed (when Niklas was using skWiki)
[ ] Quick strokes don’t work (ref: Joran creating circles -- related to lag issue)
[ ] Undo, Redo, and Image upload buttons to be redesigned
[ ] Difficult to draw details (can be done with zoom to an extent)
[ ] If the browser is zoomed in, toolbars should still be docked to the left of the viewport
[X ] Color Palette bug

Some suggestions by Prof.Ramani/ Joran
[ ] Compute gradient, shadow etc. after pen-up event, this may reduce the lag
[ ] Reduce # of points created for interpolation?
